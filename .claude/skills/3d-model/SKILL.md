# 3D models and FX

Build, reskin or animate a prop for a plugin's workshop addon, or give it FX: a glow, moving parts
or a particle effect. Models are built in the user's open Blender session through the `blender`
MCP and Blender Source Tools. Particle effects need no Blender.

The flow: check the tools, read what the plugin expects, build, review with the user, then export,
compile, wire into the plugin and clean up. Nothing is exported before the user approves.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/check.py` | Checks the tools outside Blender |
| `scripts/compile.py` | Compiles one model or particle folder and installs it |
| `scripts/particles.py` | Checks `.vpcf` field names; lists a class's fields and the game's particle textures |
| `scripts/modelkit/` | The helpers you run inside Blender, below |
| `examples/jump_pad.py` | A skinned, animated prop. Read it before building one |
| `examples/teleporter.py` | Glow, team colour and FX animations. Read it before adding FX |

| `modelkit` module | For |
| --- | --- |
| `session` | Status, scenes, opening models, cleanup |
| `surfaces` | Textures and preview materials |
| `shapes` | Mesh parts |
| `objects` | Finishing, joining and editing parts |
| `rig` | Skeleton and actions |
| `preview` | Renders and the user's viewport |
| `source2` | DMX export and the `.blend` |
| `modeldoc` | `.vmat`, `.vmdl` and `.vpcf` writers; also runs without Blender |

One Blender unit is one Source unit; +X is forward and +Z is up. A player is 32 × 32 × 72 units,
with eyes at 64.

## 1. Check the tools

```bash
uv run python .claude/skills/3d-model/scripts/check.py <plugin>
```

Then load the kit in Blender:

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, r"<repo>/.claude/skills/3d-model/scripts")
import modelkit
modelkit.reload()
from modelkit import session, surfaces, shapes, objects, rig, preview, source2, modeldoc
result = session.status()
```

Stop and tell the user if:

- Blender or its MCP doesn't answer.
- `source_tools_enabled` is false.
- `check.py` reports MISSING. Codex only matters for new textures, and a running CS2 only blocks
  installing.

If the user has unsaved changes, work only in the model's own scene.

## 2. Pick the path

| Situation | Start with |
| --- | --- |
| A new model | Step 3, then `session.scene(name, "models/<plugin>/<model>/")` |
| A model with a `.blend` | `session.open_model(<blend>, <scene>)` |
| A model with DMX files only, such as a stand-in | `session.import_dmx(scene, folder, meshes, animations)`; check it, then `source2.remember(...)` |
| New textures only | Step 4, then step 8 |
| FX | A glow or a moving part: open or import the model, then steps 5 and 6. A particle effect: [Particles](#particles) |

`open_model` refuses names the session already holds, because Blender would rename a material to
`x.vmat.001` and break the DMX. Pass `replace=True` only to reload over your own copy.

## 3. Read what the plugin expects

Before designing, find what the plugin assumes about the model. Keep every name it uses, or change
the code in the same task.

- **Path:** grep the plugin for `.vmdl`. In Stronghold it's `src/Config/ItemAssets.cpp`.
- **Size:** the scale, placement box, trigger radii (the jump pad's `Launcher`) and offsets
  measured on the mesh, such as muzzles and `PartAt`.
- **Names:** attachments, animations, material groups (`SkinOf`) and bones.
- **Assets doc:** the plugin's `docs/assets.md` has the addon layout and licence status.

## 4. Textures

List `~/.codex/generated_images/` before the first run, so cleanup knows which folders are new.
Then run Codex in the background while you work:

```bash
codex exec --skip-git-repo-check --sandbox workspace-write -C "<scratchpad>/tex" "Use the imagegen skill (built-in image_gen tool) to generate <name>.png: albedo texture for a low-poly CS2 prop; perfectly seamless and tileable on both axes; flat orthographic; evenly lit albedo only (no baked shadows, highlights, perspective or vignette); square 1024x1024; no text, logos or watermark. Subject: <material>. Copy the final image into the current directory as <name>.png."
```

- Look at every result. Brushed metal turns into wood grain on curves, so ask for powder-coated or
  speckled metal.
- `surfaces.replace_texture(generated, color_png, normal_png, strength)` installs a texture at
  1024 px under the existing name, so every `.vmat` stays valid, and rebuilds its normal map. Use a
  strength of about 1.5 for painted metal and 10 for raised patterns.
- `surfaces.brightened` makes a lighter or darker variant. `surfaces.solid` makes glow colours and
  masks.

## 5. Build or edit

Write the build as a scratchpad script and run it with `execute_blender_code`. Stay in the model's
scene, and give imported references a scene of their own.

- **New parts:** make the geometry with `shapes` and cut holes with `objects.cut`.
  `objects.finish` bevels, maps UVs, sets the material and binds the part to a bone.
  `objects.join` makes the render mesh and `objects.hull` the collision.
- **A finished mesh:** `objects.vertices(body, material=..., bone=...)` picks a part, and
  `objects.transform` moves or scales it. Add parts with `objects.join([body, *parts], body.name)`
  and repoint a renamed material with `objects.replace_material`. To only resize, use the
  plugin's scale.
- **Size:** compare against a player. A floor prop over about 40 units wide looks oversized.
- **Detail:** add bevels, a trim material, bolts, vents, an inset and normal maps. 5–12k
  triangles is fine.
- **Glow:** keep it to thin lines and small markers at glow 1.0. A large glow reads as flat colour,
  even under a grate; light it from a core that fades to dark instead, like the teleporter's well.
- **Team colour** goes on a thin glowing part that players see from a distance, such as a strip,
  with its own material remapped in `blue`/`red` material groups.

## 6. Animate

`rig.skeleton` makes the bones and skins the mesh by vertex group. `rig.animate` records an action
from per-bone `(frame, move, turn)` keys at 30 fps, relative to rest. `rig.eased` fills in the
frames between keys without overshoot. `source2.remember` saves the export settings in the
`.blend`.

- **Exaggerate:** a 10-unit lift looked static in game. Crouch, overshoot, then bounce to rest.
- **Idle:** anything that should look alive needs a moving `idle` loop, and the plugin must start
  it (step 9). A loop ends on its first key.
- **Turning parts** end every action on whole turns, so the loop picks up cleanly after a
  one-shot.
- **FX as animation:** put a glowing part on its own bone and move it. The teleporter's light
  strip lifts off as a hoop and sweeps past the player, which made a planned particle burst
  unnecessary.
- **Check** a few frames of each action with `preview.contact_sheet`, looking for parts that clip.

## 7. Review with the user

- Stage the scene with `preview.stage()` and show the model with `preview.frame_viewport`.
- Render stills from a player's view with `preview.render`: about 64 units up, 60–80 away.
- Tell the user how to play an action: select the armature, pick the action in the Action Editor,
  press Space.
- Iterate. Export nothing before they approve.

## 8. Export and compile

```python
source2.export(scene, model_dir)                        # meshes, hull, one DMX per action
source2.save_blend(scene, model_dir + "/<model>.blend")  # goes to Git LFS, not the compile
modeldoc.write_vmat(...)  # only for new or changed materials
modeldoc.write_vmdl(...)  # only when meshes, animations, groups or attachments change
```

Stop the CS2 server and client first; installing into a running game fails.

```bash
uv run python .claude/skills/3d-model/scripts/compile.py plugins/<plugin>/addon models/<plugin>/<model> --install client server
```

- `export` refuses `.001` materials and leaves object references stale, so look objects up by
  name afterwards.
- `compile.py` mirrors the folder into the Workshop Tools content folder, recompiles it from
  scratch and copies the result to each install target.

## 9. Wire it into the plugin

- Point the plugin at the `.vmdl`, and update the scale, placement box, trigger radii and measured
  offsets. In Stronghold, `Scale` in `ItemAssets` resizes the model, collision and animation
  without a recompile.
- Start a loop with the `SetAnimationLooping` input; in Stronghold, name it in `Idle` in
  `ItemAssets`. `prop_dynamic` has no `SetAnimation` input (`game/core/base.fgd`).
- Play a one-shot with `Entity::PlayAnimation(animation, idle)`, which returns to the loop after.
- Record new or replaced assets, and how they were made, in the plugin's assets doc.
- Build with `build-local`, install with `uv run poe install <plugin>`, and check that the
  installed DLL's hash matches the build.

## 10. Clean up

The task is done when nothing it created is left without a purpose.

- **Blender:** `session.remove_scene` for every scene the task made other than the model, then
  `session.purge()`. Leave the user's own scenes alone.
- **Model folder:** `compile.py --prune` deletes sources nothing names, such as replaced textures.
  Delete stray exports by hand: `anims/`, or a DMX named after a Blender object.
- **Game folders:** if a model or effect folder was renamed or removed, delete its old copy under
  `content/csgo_addons/<addon>/`, `game/csgo_addons/<addon>/` and `game/csgo/`, on the client and
  the server.
- **Plugin:** remove constants, config and doc lines that only served the replaced model.
- **Scratch:** delete the scratchpad files, and the `~/.codex/generated_images/` folders your runs
  added.
- **Git:** `git status` shows only the files you meant to change. Commit with the `commit` skill
  when asked.

## Particles

Use a particle effect for sparks, smoke or light that fades. Try glow and animation first: they
live in the model, while an effect is a separate file the plugin must spawn, precache and remove.

1. **Write** each effect into `<addon>/particles/<plugin>/<effect>/` with `modeldoc.write_vpcf`,
   built from `modeldoc.op(...)` operators. A team variant is its own file; a part several effects
   share is a child.
2. **Check the field names.** `resourcecompiler` silently drops fields it doesn't know, so a typo
   compiles into an effect without that setting. `particles.py fields <class>` prints the real
   names: `C_INIT_RandomLifeTime` takes `m_fLifetimeMin`, not `m_flLifetimeMin`.
3. **Compile and install.** `compile.py` runs `particles.py check` first and stops on an unknown
   field:

   ```bash
   uv run python .claude/skills/3d-model/scripts/compile.py plugins/<plugin>/addon particles/<plugin>/<effect> --install client server
   ```

4. **Review.** Nothing renders particles outside the game, so the user checks them in game or in
   the Workshop Tools particle editor (`cs2.exe -tools`).
5. **Wire.** `runtime.Entities.SpawnParticle(effect, origin, angles)` starts an effect, and
   removing the entity stops it. Keep a loop's `EntityRef` and remove it with its owner. Give a
   one-shot `RemoveAfter(seconds)`, longer than its longest particle life. Precache every `.vpcf`
   the plugin spawns; children load with it. In Stronghold, `ParticleT` and `ParticleCt` in
   `ItemAssets` loop at a structure's origin.

- **Textures:** use the game's own, such as `materials/particle/particle_glow_01.vtex` (soft
  glow), `beam_hotwhite.vtex` (streaks) or `sparks/sparks.vtex`. `particles.py textures <word>`
  lists them.
- **Schema dump:** the field checks read `references/swiftlys2`, which is local only. Without it,
  `compile.py` says so and compiles unchecked.
- **On an existing model:** measure the point in Blender, from the `.blend` or
  `session.import_dmx`, and spawn the effect at the prop's origin plus that offset, turned by its
  yaw (Stronghold's `OffsetByYaw`). The effect won't follow a moving part; animate a glowing part
  for that.
