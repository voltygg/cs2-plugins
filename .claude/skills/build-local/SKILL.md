# Build locally

## Compile and test

The Bash tool has no MSVC. Use the PowerShell tool and load the dev shell in the same call:

```powershell
$env:PATH = "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer;$env:PATH"
& "$(vswhere -latest -property installationPath)\Common7\Tools\Launch-VsDevShell.ps1" -Arch amd64 -HostArch amd64 -SkipAutomaticLocation | Out-Null
uv run poe test          # compiles, then CTest; -R <regex> narrows. `poe build` only compiles
```

Output: `build/windows-msvc-release/plugins/<name>/windows-x86_64/<name>.dll`. `windows-msvc-debug`
does not link (the prebuilt protobuf is Release). Linux builds only in the CI container; see
`deploy-test`. `uv run poe lint` runs ruff, the source conventions, the Panorama and schema checks.

## Against the voltmod checkout

`conan.lock` pins a released voltmod. To build against `voltmod/`, register it once (check with
`uv run conan editable list`):

```powershell
uv run conan editable add voltmod   # poe build/test now compile the checkout first
uv run poe build --relock           # before committing, from the repo root
```

`--relock` exports the checkout, pins it in `conan.lock`, drops the editable and fails if the build
did not use it. Commit `conan.lock` with the change; CI resolves it only after a voltmod release
(`release` skill). The framework's own tests: `uv run poe test` inside `voltmod`.

## Install into the local server

```powershell
uv run poe run <plugin>        # build, install, launch
uv run poe install [plugin]    # copy only; no name copies every plugin and the host
uv run poe panorama            # compile the Panorama screens into your own client
```

Install seeds each file under `configs/` once and keeps later edits. Stop `cs2.exe` first, or the
copy fails with `WinError 32`. A plugin with a custom UI shows nothing until `poe panorama` has run
(needs CS2 Workshop Tools). Confirm the load with `volt list` (`rcon-debug`).

## Failures

- `CreateProcess failed: The system cannot find the file specified`: Strawberry was removed from
  `PATH`; ccache lives in `C:\Strawberry\c\bin`.
- `Access is denied` on `voltmod\.venv\Scripts\voltmod.exe`: a hung build holds the venv. Stop
  `Get-Process | ? Path -like "*voltmod\.venv*"`.
- `--relock` says the build tree is not configured against the package: delete
  `build/windows-msvc-release` and rerun.
- SDK binaries missing from the Conan cache: `uv run poe release build sdk` inside `voltmod`.
- Profiles or remote missing: `uv run poe bootstrap`.
- An include compiles here and fails on Linux CI: fix its case (`Color.h`, `KeyValues.h`,
  `CommandBuffer.h`, `PlayerState.h`).

## Report

Preset, whether voltmod was relocked, the CTest result, the output path, and anything skipped.
